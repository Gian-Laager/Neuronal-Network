SYCL_ has a lot of interesting advantages compared to plain OpenCL_ or
other approaches:

- SYCL_ is an open standard from Khronos_ with a working committee
  (you can contribute!) and we can expect several implementations
  (commercial or open source) on many platforms soon, ranging from
  GPU, APU, FPGA, DSP, CGRA, AI/ML accelerators... down to plain CPU;

- it offers a *single-source* `C++`_ programming model that allows
  taking advantage of the modern C++20 superpower, unifying both
  the host and accelerator sides. For example it is possible to write
  generic accelerated functions on the accelerators in a terse way by
  using (variadic) templates, meta-programming and generic variadic
  lambda expressions. This allows to build templated libraries such as
  Eigen_ or TensorFlow_ in a seamless way;

- SYCL_ abstracts and leverages the concepts behind OpenCL_ and provides
  higher-level concepts such as tasks (or command group in OpenCL_ or SYCL_
  jargon) that allow the runtime to take advantage of a more task
  graph-oriented view of the computations. This allows lazy data
  transfers between accelerators and host or to use platform
  capabilities such as OpenCL_ 2 SVM or HSA_ for sharing data between
  host and accelerators;

- the entry cost of the technology is zero since, after all, an existing
  OpenCL_ or `C++`_ program is a valid SYCL_ program;

- the exit cost is low since it is *pure* `C++`_ *without any*
  extension or ``#pragma``, by opposition to `C++AMP`_ or OpenMP_ for
  example. Retargeting the SYCL_ classes and functions to use other
  frameworks such as OpenMP_ 5, CUDA_ or `C++AMP`_ is feasible without
  rewriting a new compiler for example. This is actually what is done in
  the `hipSYCL`_ implementation for CUDA_ or HIP_;

- easier debugging

  - since all memory accesses to array parameters in kernels go through
    accessors, all the memory bound checks can be done in them if needed;

  - since there is a pure host mode, the kernel code can be run also on
    the host and debugged using the usual tools and use any system (such
    ``<cstdio>`` or ``<iostream>``...) or data libraries (for nice data
    visualization);

  - by lowering some architectural features down to plain CPU C++, you
    can even debug weird data-race problems with standard tools such
    as Valgrind/Helgrind, Clang/GCC ThreadSanitizer...

  - since the kernel code is `C++`_ code even when run on an accelerator,
    instrumenting the code by using special array classes or overloading
    some operators allows deep intrusive debugging or code analysis
    without changing the algorithmic parts of the code;

- SYCL_ is high-level standard modern `C++`_ without any extension, that means
  that you can use your usual compiler and the host part can use at
  the *same time* some cool and common extensions such as OpenMP_,
  OpenHMPP_, OpenACC_,... or libraries such as MPI_ or PGAS Coarray++,
  be linked with other parts written in other languages
  (Fortran_...). Thus SYCL_ is already Exascale-ready!

- even if SYCL_ hides the OpenCL_ world by default, an OpenCL_-based
  implementation inherit from all the OpenCL_ world:

  - same interoperability as the OpenCL_ underlying platform: Vulkan_,
    OpenGL_, DirectX_...

  - access to all the underlying basic OpenCL_ objects behind the SYCL_
    abstraction for interoperability and hard-core optimization;

  - construction of SYCL_ objects from basic OpenCL_ objects to add some
    SYCL_ parts to an existing OpenCL_ application;

  - so it provides a continuum from higher-level programming `Ã  la`
    `C++AMP`_ or OpenMP_ 4 down to low-level OpenCL_, according to the
    optimization needs, from using simple OpenCL_ intrinsics or vector
    operation from the ``cl::sycl`` namespace down to providing a real
    OpenCL_ kernel to be executed without requiring all the verbose
    usual OpenCL_ host API.

  This OpenCL_ seamless integration plus the gradual optimization features
  are perhaps the most compelling arguments for SYCL_ because it allows
  high-level programming simplicity without giving-up hard-core
  performance when needed;

- since the SYCL_ task graph execution model is asynchronous, this can be
  used by side effect to overcome some underlying OpenCL_ implementation
  limitations. For example, some OpenCL_ stacks may have only in-order
  execution queues or even synchronous (blocking) ND-range enqueue, or
  some weird constrained mapping between OpenCL_ programmer level queue(s)
  and the hardware queues.

  In this case, a SYCL_ implementation can deal with this, relying for
  example on multiple host CPU threads, multiple thread-local-storage
  (TLS) queues, its own scheduler, etc. atop the limited OpenCL_ stack to
  provide computation and communication overlap in a natural pain-free
  fashion. This relieves the programmer to reorganize her application to
  work around these limitations, which can be quite cumbersome work.

For introduction material on the interest of DSEL_ in this area, look for
example at these articles:

Some other implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some other known implementations:

- Codeplay_ provides ComputeCpp_, the most achieved implementation of
  a fully compliant SYCL_, mainly targeting OpenCL_ & SPIR_ with
  Clang_/LLVM_ but also supporting some onther back-ends such as CUDA_
  from NVIDIA. It is not open-source but there is a free community
  version;

- Intel SYCL ``DPC++``_ open-source implementation which is in the process of
  being up-streamed to Clang_/LLVM_;

- hipSYCL_, an implementation of SYCL_ over NVIDIA CUDA_ or AMD HIP_;

- a mix of triSYCL_ and Intel SYCL `DPC++`_ implementation trying to
  unify 2 open-source implementations to expose advantages of both of
  them https://github.com/triSYCL/sycl;

- SYCL-GTX, an implementation using some macros to avoid relying on a
  device compiler https://github.com/ProGTX/sycl-gtx.
